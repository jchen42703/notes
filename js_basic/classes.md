# Javascript Classes
* Exist as syntactic sugar over the object/prototype API
* The syntax is similar to regular Java:
  * Create a class with the `class` keyword
  ```
  class Car {
      constructor(brand) {
        this.carname = brand;
      }
      present() {
        return 'I have a ' + this.carname;
      }
  }
  ```
  * Inherit a class with the `extends` keyword:
  ```
  class Model extends Car {
      constructor(brand, mod) {
        super(brand);
        this.model = mod;
      }
      show() {
        return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model;
      }
  }
  ```
  * Call the super class constructor with `super`: `super(arguments);  // calls the parent constructor (only inside the constructor)`
  * Call a parent method with `super`: `super.parentMethod(arguments);  // calls a parent method`

## [Please stop using classes in JavaScript](https://everyday.codes/javascript/please-stop-using-classes-in-javascript/)

* __Binding issues:__ As class constructor functions deal closely with this keyword, it can introduce potential binding issues, especially if you try to pass your class method as a callback to an external routine (hello, React devs ðŸ‘‹)
* [__Performance issues:__](https://medium.com/@gregsolo/es6-classes-vs-prototypes-performance-overview-dcab1e2fca9b) Because of classesâ€™ implementation, they are notoriously difficult to optimize at runtime. While we enjoy performant machines at the moment, the fact that Mooreâ€™s law is fading away can change all that.
  * __Note:__ The performance issues are really only present when you have a large number of objects and in Chrome.
* __Private variables.__ One of the great advantages and the main reasons for classes in the first place, private variables, is just non-existent in JS.
* __Strict hierarchies.__ Classes introduce a straight top-to-bottom order and make changes harder to implement, which is unacceptable in most JS applications.
* __Because the React team tells you not to.__ While they did not explicitly deprecate the class-based components yet, they are likely to in the near future.
